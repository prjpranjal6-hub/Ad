# LuluStream-Embeds-NoAds

**LuluStream-Embeds-NoAds** is a minimalist, serverless proxy built with **Node.js**, leveraging **Axios** and **Cheerio** to fetch and sanitize video embed content from **LuluStream**. Its goal is simple yet powerful: strip all ads from embedded players, returning a clean and safe iframe for use on any website or application.
